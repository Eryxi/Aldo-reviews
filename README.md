# üîç Review Analysis Extension ‚Äì Lean AI-Powered Export Tool

## üìå What is the Project?

A browser extension that allows users to **import review CSVs**, generate **summarized reports**, and **export** them into readable formats like PDF or DOCX ‚Äî all **without retaining user data** unless explicitly imported. Once the extension is closed, all live conversations are **purged**, leaving only the final export accessible anytime.

## ü§ù How It Helps Users

- Gives users **concise, structured summaries** of reviews instantly.
- Allows them to **save/export insights** easily for reports or stakeholder sharing.
- Protects privacy: no data is kept unless intentionally imported.
- Keeps interaction simple: **just 2 clicks away** from results.

---

## üí° Why It's Important

- People are flooded with unstructured feedback (e.g. product reviews, app ratings).
- Reading all reviews is time-consuming and inefficient.
- Summarized insights help **product teams, marketers, and founders** understand patterns faster.
- Offers a **GDPR-friendly** way to process data with minimal retention.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Risk Mitigation

- **Data is never stored** unless user imports CSV.
- Temporary conversations are deleted on extension close.
- No data sent externally unless necessary ‚Äî local processing where possible.
- The system **analyzes** reviews but never **alters** or **hallucinates** them.
- Exported reports are factual summaries; no AI-generated opinions passed off as truth.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Overview

### Backend
- **FastAPI** or **Node.js (Express)** for light LLM handling
- **Redis** for short-term caching of review clusters or summaries
- **LLM API** or self-hosted model for summarization
- Optional **background job queue** (e.g., Celery or BullMQ)

### Frontend / Extension
- Chrome extension using **Vanilla JS** or **React**
- CSV import, trigger analysis, and export functionalities
- Client-side rendering of exports using `pdf-lib`, `docx`, etc.
- No persistent frontend storage

## üß† LLM Pipeline + Cost Optimization

### Original Plan:
- GPT-4
- 500 calls/day √ó 30 days = 15,000 calls/month ‚Üí **~$275‚Äì$315/month**

### Final Lean Pipeline:
1. **Input Cleaning:** Pre-truncate reviews (max 100‚Äì200 characters), remove noise
2. **Batching:** Group similar reviews before sending to LLM
3. **Use GPT-3.5 or Open Source LLMs:** Lower cost dramatically
4. **Cache + Reuse Summaries:** Store temporary summaries in Redis
5. **Local Embedding & Clustering:** Reduces LLM load by 80‚Äì90%
6. **One-shot summarization:** Batch ~20 reviews at once for $0.002 per batch

### Final Cost:
- **GPT-3.5 optimized:** $1‚Äì$4/month
- **Open-source model (e.g. Mistral, LLaMA 2):** $0/month, infra only

## üßæ Why Lean Prompts Matter

- Short, focused prompts = faster response + lower cost
- Batching reviews keeps tokens/token usage down
- Prompts are designed to **extract insights** only ‚Äî no hallucinations
- Ensures **truthful summarization** without changing the user‚Äôs original reviews
- Final output = analytical, structured, **not fabricated content**

---

## ‚úÖ TL;DR

You built a lean review summarization tool as a browser extension that:
- **Lets users import CSVs, summarize reviews, and export reports**
- **Deletes all non-essential data by default**
- Uses **lean prompts** + batching + local clustering to cut LLM cost
- Final cost dropped from **$315/month ‚Üí as low as $1‚Äì$4/month**
- Fully **privacy-first**, no hallucinations, legally mindful
